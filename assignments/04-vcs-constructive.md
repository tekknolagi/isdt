# Homework 4: VCS, Constructive

## Tracking changes with Git: maintainer for a day

You co-maintain a software project with your mustachioed friend Tommaso. You
normally split your maintainer duties evenly, but he has taken a well-deserved
two week vacation to a beach in France and left you completely in charge.
Throughout this week, a number of situations have come up and it is your duty
to deal with them! In this assignment, we will have you modify a Git repository
with several sequential steps that you must translate to Git commands.

Many of these questions are graded solely by the final state of the repository
you submit to us. For the ones that aren't, we expect you to tell us what
commands you ran and why, as in prior assignments. See the first question for
instructions on how to submit your answers to such questions.

Expect to make good use of `git reflog` in this assignment as you make errors.

Start by cloning the initial repository from
`/comp/50ISDT/vcs2-constructive.git`. We suggest you work on the homework
server, but you are also free to work on a personal computer (make sure you
have `clang-format` installed if so).

1. A number of the following questions ask you to tell us what commands you
   used. Put your answers in the `answers.txt` file in the `answers` branch.
   **Create a local `answers` branch based on the initial one by running `git
   checkout -b answers origin/answers`.** (Since this is such a common
   operation, you can also use the shorthand `git checkout answers` to do the
   same thing.) As you answer our questions, make commits to that branch. You
   may commit your answers either one-by-one or all at once, but make sure
   you've committed them by the time you submit!
1. A user named Gianna opened a GitHub issue pointing out that the project has
   no LICENSE file, meaning she doesn't know if she's allowed to use the
   software in the way she wants. You did some research and found that the [MIT
   license](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) is appropriate for the
   project. **Add a new file called LICENSE containing the license text from
   that link (with appropriate placeholders filled in), then commit the
   addition to the `main` branch with a descriptive commit message.**
1. Encouraged by your prompt addition of a license, Gianna has done some work
   to adapt the project to her needs. She has sent you a pull request, asking
   you to review the changes in `gianna-increase-int-size` and add them to the
   `main` branch if possible. You review the changes and they look great--no
   revision needed! **Create a merge commit on `main` that merges the tip of
   `gianna-increase-int-size` with the tip of `main`.**
1. You receive another pull request, this one from a person named Dr.
   Garbarini. You don't know him, but the changes look reasonable to you.
   Unfortunately, Garbarini doesn't seem to care about making his commit
   history look nice: the branch he wants you to merge, `garbarini-branch`, is
   full of commits with titles like "doc" and no further description. You
   decide that it's best to add all his changes to `main` as a single commit to
   cut down on the noise. **Create a new commit on `main` consisting of all the
   changes from `garbarini-branch` since it diverged from `main`. Tell us how
   you did so.** Note that it is possible to do this without manually copying
   any files or code--if you find yourself re-entering things, there's probably
   a better way.
   1. You will encounter some merge conflicts during this question. **Please
      resolve those conflicts so that the intent of each conflicting change is
      preserved.** This will require you to read the changes and understand
      what they do.
1. Massimo, a regular contributor, has been working on adding a new feature for
   quite some time, and he finally posted his changes to the
   `add-new-operators` branch. Unlike Dr.  Garbarini, his commits are
   masterfully documented, and you want to add them to `main` as is. But you
   notice that the commit titled "Support modulo operator" has some formatting
   errors. You can run `clang-format -i` to automatically fix those errors, but
   you want to include the fix as part of the original commit instead of
   putting it in a separate one.
   1. **Change the `add-new-operators` branch to point to an updated version of
      the same set of commits (with matching commit messages, titles, and
      diffs) with fixed formatting in the problematic change. Tell us how you
      did so.**
   1. **Now that the commits are ready, add them to `main` by rebasing them.**
      This is different from merging, like you did with Gianna's branch: in
      this case, you should make no new merge commits.
1. Uh oh! You just noticed that Dr. Garbarini's branch included a commit that
   removed several lines from `Makefile`. You ask him why and learn that it was
   an accident--he always creates his commits using `git commit -a`, and so he
   didn't notice that he'd inadvertently deleted some code. Since you've
   already pushed his changes to the public, it's too late to amend them.
   **Create a new commit on `main` that restores `Makefile` back to how it was
   before Dr. Garbarini's change. Tell us how you did so. Mention the hash of
   the commit (on `main`) that removed the lines in your commit message.**
1. Alessia is a disgruntled user of your open source project. She opened
   [an issue](04-vcs-constructive-issue.txt) maligning the project and its
   esteemed maintainers. Write an appropriately cool and collected response
   before the discussion gets too spicy, and put that response in
   `answers.txt`.

   We have some recommended reading about open source maintainership. There is
   not one definitive experience or truth about the role. You should read about
   it and come to your own conclusions about conduct.

## Submitting your work

To submit, first join our [GitHub Classroom
instance](https://classroom.github.com/a/GJz9jQnu). You will need a GitHub
account to do this. Once you've joined, you should be able to find yourself on
the class roster, after which you will see a repository belonging to you for
the "vcs-constructive" assignment. Add this repository as a remote to the local
repository where you've been working, then push your `main` and `answers`
branches to that remote. If you do this correctly, you'll see both branches
shown in GitHub's web UI.

## Notes on being an open source maintainer

The basic idea is: software is made by people. Be kind to them. Build an
inclusive community.

Adding a [code of conduct](https://opensource.guide/code-of-conduct/) to your
project is a step in the right direction. Pick one you like. It will codify the
way you would like contributors to interact. In some circumstances, you may
have to "tap the sign" and remind people to be respectful.

You may get angry issues or pull requests sometimes. There are several
approaches to handling this.

* You could point to your code of conduct and close the issue/PR.
* You could respond in a businesslike fashion. In one particularly famous
  example, the developers [ignore the
  tone](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/PYTHON-532) and the original angry
  person calms down and apologizes.
* You could respond with your own tirade, which might also violate your code of
  conduct.
* You could ignore it until it becomes an ember burning in the back of your
  mind, eventually causing you to write a blog post about maintainer burnout.
